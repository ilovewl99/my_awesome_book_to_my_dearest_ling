一、[动词](http://www.yingyuyufa.com/cixing/dongci/)的否定转移

1. 形式上否定主句的谓语，实际上是否定从句的谓语

当动词think, believe, suppose, imagine, expect, feel的主语是第一人称、谓语动词为没有任何[副词](http://www.yingyuyufa.com/cixing/fuci/)修饰的[一般现在时](http://www.yingyuyufa.com/shitai/yibanxianzaishi/)，它们的否定式实际上是对[宾语从句](http://www.yingyuyufa.com/congju/mingcixing/binyu/)的否定。表示说话者提出一种委婉的看法或主张。如：

I think that he will help us. —I don't think that he will help us. 我认为它不会帮助我们。

I believe that he is right. —I don't believe that he is right. 我认为他不对。

I suppose that he likes it. —I don't suppose that he likes it. 我想他不喜欢它。

1. 形式上否定谓语动词，实际上否定复合宾语

当动词think, believe, suppose, imagine, expect, feel, find的主语是第一人称、谓语动词为没有任何副词修饰的一般现在时，它们前面的否定式实际上是对复合宾语的否定。表示说话者所提出的一种委婉的看法或主张。如：

I think math difficult. — I don't think math difficult. 我认为数学不难。

I find the story interesting. — I don't find the story interesting. 我认为这个故事没有趣。

I expect so. —I don't expect so. 我认为不会。
